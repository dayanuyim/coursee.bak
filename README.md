* Goad
  - Minimize the effort to plan (collecting data) and to record a course.
  - Integrate gpx/map, md, and photo images locally.
  - Static pages, No server side, for easy spread.
  - Maintain a html-enhanced view and data format, but not data itself.
  - Data can be read from / saving to markdown easily.

Callanges
  - how to save files? Maybe export a markdown file to overwrite the original.
